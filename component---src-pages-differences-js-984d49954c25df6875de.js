At the time, mostly hydraulics were used to manage all the vehicle sub systems, including steering, cooling, breaking etc. Slowly, these systems have been converted to electric systems. However, acceleration and transmission (at least in India market) are still manual."),n.createElement("p",null,"With EV we have to rethink acceleration and transmission. Users only have to understand speed. Internal softwares can do the calculations and derive the current throughput to achive that speed. Also, unlike ICE that are tuned for max power output at specific RPMs, Batteries have a wider range of high power output. This implies, we do not need a multi-gear transmission system. These considerations will change the drive experience a lot. Imagine turning a knob to set the desired vehicle speed and relaxing as the vehicle auto adjusts its parameters to meet you wishes."))}}}]);
