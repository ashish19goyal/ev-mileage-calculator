# Battery Design
It has 3 aspects
- Mechanical Design
- Electric Design
- Thermal Design

## Mechanical Design
The material for mechanical design is identified using Ashby methodology
- Maximize or minimize the objective function
- Screening
- Ranking
- Supporting information

Mechanical design is evaluated by vibration analysis. It has the following components
- Deterministic
  - Spectrum
  - Transient
  - Harmonic  
- Non-deterministic
  - Random

** Spectrum and Transient are shock analysis
** Harmonic and Random are vibration analysis
